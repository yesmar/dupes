The `dupes` command identifies duplicate files within the user-specified set of target files and directories. It does this by walking the specified file systems, computing and comparing SHA-256 hashes of the files it encounters. Any hash that has been seen previously is considered a duplicate.

Important considerations:

- Zero-length files serve as a trigger mechanism on many operating systems. Removing such files could have negative effects, so `dupes` completely ignores empty files.
- Symbolic links *will* be followed, which could lead to trouble should a cycle be encountered. `dupes` assumes that you know what you are doing and understand the file systems you intend to run it on.

The author uses `dupes` to identify and delete duplicate images downloaded from [imgur](https://imgur.com).

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/yesmar/dupes
```

Note that the `vendor` directory is here for stability. Remove it if you already have the dependencies in your `GOPATH`.

## Usage

```bash
Usage: dupes [options] <pathname> [â€¦]
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-no-color` | Disable color output |
| `-verbose` | Verbose output |
| `-version` | Display version information |

You can pass any combination of files and directory pathnames to `dupes`. The pathnames of duplicate files are output, one to a line. To do something further with these pathnames, pipe `stdout` to `xargs` or a similar program.

## Examples

By default, `dupes` prints the pathnames of duplicate files to `stdout`.

```bash
dupes /tmp
```

Any errors encountered will be output in alarming red on `stderr`. If you do not wish to see error output, redirect `stderr` to `/dev/null`, e.g.:

```bash
dupes /var 2>/dev/null
```

Output from `dupes` can be piped to `xargs` to perform operations on duplicate files, e.g.:

```bash
dupes /tmp | xargs ls -l
```

Pass the `-verbose` flag if you wish to see additional information. Verbose output is incompatible with `xargs` so it is output to `stderr` as a safeguard.

Duplicate pathnames containing embedded spaces causes problems for `xargs` and friends. If you had been using `find`, you could have passed it the `-print0` switch and invoked `xargs` with `-0`. Although `dupes` does not have a `-print0` option, it can be simulated using `sed` to quote the strings:

```bash
dupes /var 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*/"&"/' | xargs ls -l
```

## Notes for Windows users

Color output is not working as expected in Windows 10 consoles. Until a proper fix can be implemented, use the `-no-color` flag when running `dupes.exe`.

Alas, the above examples make use of `xargs`, which is not a native Windows program. There are a number of `xargs` implementations for Windows. Feel free to use one. Alternately, you can run `dupes.exe` from a Git Bash window and pipe output to `xargs`.

Building from source is not currently as easy/fun as it is on Linux and macOS. Windows uses `nmake`, and `Makefile` and `config.mk` are written for GNU Make. But don't worry. It's easy to approximate things. Just `type config.mk`, remember the version number and type:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.release=VERSION" -o dupes.exe
```

Replace `VERSION` with the version number you saw in `config.mk`, e.g., `1.1.0`.
